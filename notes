Noting the steps I've taken to try to port a traditional Unix build over the Linux Kernel.

Step 1: Pull main source
* requires CVS *
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom \
  login
  CVS password:<just type return>
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom \
  co -P heirloom

Step 2: Aquire Traditional Bourne shell
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom \
  login
  CVS password:<just type return>
  ^^ if not still logged in ^^
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom \
  co -P heirloom-sh

$ cd heirloom-sh
$ make

## make works using gcc without errors.
## note, I'm building from /home/<me>/...so reflect

$ cp /bin/sh /bin/sh-backup
$ cp ~/heirloom-sh/ /bin/ush

edit /etc/shells to include /bin/ush
$ chsh
    (password entered here)
    /bin/ush

## log out, log back in, new shell up.
## cd back into build directory (~/heirloom/)
## edit ~/heirloom/build/mk.config
SHELL = /bin/ush

## edit ~/heirloom/makefile (LOWERCASE one)
SHELL = /bin/ush

....and build fails to to lack of
....a Unix compatible yacc (my bad. -_-)

Step 3:
## drop back to main directory (~/)
## Pull required Development tools from here:
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@heirloom.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/heirloom \
  co -P heirloom-devtools

## cd to ~/heirloom-devtools
## edit mk.config to point to our Bourne shell
SHELL = /bin/ush
INSTALL = /usr/local/bin
PREFIX = /usr/local

## install a c++ compatible compiler (g++ is what I used)
##in ~/heirloom-devtools
make
make install
*make mrproper, if something is broke ;) *
....Build fails: /bin/ush: /usr/local/bin: cannot execute
## yacc has built, but is not located in the /usr/local/bin dir.
## at this point, I attempt to maunually cp yacc and lex from
## the build directory directly into /usr/local/bin...may not work. O_o

## doesn't, missing /usr/local/lib/yaccpar
$ cp ~/heirloom-dev/yacc/yaccpar /usr/local/lib


### Okie, dokie, that works.^_^, but now showing:
##  ls.c:115:20: fatal error: curses.h: No such file or directory
##   #include <curses.h>

###....the DebJoe builds curses libs
### and tries again. >.<

"awk.lx.l":line 384: Error: Lex driver missing, file /usr/local/lib/lex/ncform
## F*** YOU!!!!  Why couldn't you just install right to start with?
mkdir /usr/local/lib/lex/
cp ~/heirloom-devtools/lex/ncform /usr/local/lib/lex

## drop back to ~/heirloom/
make
make install

## Victory! ^_^
## now we have a lot of cool binaries in /usr/ucb, because that's a cool place for them
## need to add it to our $PATH
